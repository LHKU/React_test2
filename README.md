Although there are few dynamic elements, it is a homepage written in react for study.

I don't need a dynamic function, but I'm making a json server for studying and connecting it with the server to receive data.

It's a website that's made in a responsive way.

The libraries and tools used are as follows.
--Redux Toolkit
--useEffect
--axios
--react-router-dom
--useRef
--i18next
--SCSS
--Node.js
--Google Cloud Platform
--GitHub
