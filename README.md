It's not a dynamic page, but I used React to study and put some dynamic elements in it.

I made a json server(node.js) and hosted it through GCP.

The client was hosted via GitHub and Cloudflare.

Domain access is only available in Korea and Japan.

The website was constructed in a responsive manner.

The libraries used are as follows.
--Redux Toolkit
--useEffect
--axios
--react-router-dom
--useRef
--i18next
--SCSS
